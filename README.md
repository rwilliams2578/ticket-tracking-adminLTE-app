# In-Class 5 - Ticket Tracking AdminLTE App

## Author



## Description

In this In-Class we will be setting up a Django project from scratch.
Utilizing everything that we have learned so far. In addition, we will see how
to utilize a python package that can take all of the work out of making a
beautiful and functional web application pretty darn quickly using a CSS theme
called AdminLTE2. If there is time, we will see about exploring how to do
custom database queries.
